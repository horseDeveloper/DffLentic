# Disclaimer
This project exists only to improve compatibility and ease of use for software that doesn't support easily switching to alternative glyphs. Lokxend is completely based on [Lexend](https://www.lexend.com/)) but is in no way related to it; Lokxend  has a different name to avoid confusion and to facilitate finding it (typing `LE` â‰  `LO`).
